# SolQuery Agent Clients & Examples

This directory contains client applications and agent implementations designed to interact with the main SolQuery FastAPI service.

## 1. Fukuoka Nomad Assistant Application (Fetch.ai uAgent Track)

This application is specifically designed for the Fetch.ai track and Fukuoka Track of the Breakout Hackathon, focusing on the theme of "regional revitalization—such as the use of blockchain technology for digital nomad payment systems" in Fukuoka, Japan.

It comprises two main components:
* **`fukuoka_chat_app.py`**: A user-facing chat interface (e.g., built with Streamlit) that interacts with the ASI1-Mini LLM for initial query processing and then communicates with the `solquery_connector_agent`.
* **`solquery_connector_agent.py`**: A Fetch.ai uAgent that acts as a bridge between the chat application (or other uAgents) and the SolQuery backend service.

**Agent Name:** `solquery_connector_agent` (SolQuery Connector for Fukuoka Assist)

**Description:**
This uAgent serves as a crucial link in the "Fukuoka Nomad Assist" ecosystem. Its primary role is to receive structured tasks or processed natural language queries—ideally refined by an initial LLM like Fetch.ai's ASI1-Mini from a user-facing chat interface. These queries are focused on assisting users navigating Fukuoka, Japan, particularly digital nomads and tourists.

The agent specializes in connecting to the "SolQuery" backend service. SolQuery is an AI-powered engine (using Google Gemini with function calling) that accesses and interprets information regarding:
* Local Fukuoka services (e.g., crypto-friendly co-working spaces, cafes, shops – using curated/mocked data for the hackathon).
* Guidance on using Solana (SOL, USDC) for payments within the region.
* Details on Solana wallets and essential on-chain data like token balances (useful for a nomad checking their USDC for local spending).
* (Core SolQuery capabilities also include wider DeFi/NFT portfolio data and sentiment analysis, which can be leveraged if relevant to the query).

This `solquery_connector_agent` takes these specific tasks, securely queries the SolQuery FastAPI endpoint, and returns the processed information. This enables sophisticated, AI-driven assistance for users exploring Fukuoka and its potential for Web3 integration in regional revitalization. It is built using the uAgents framework and is intended to operate within the Fetch.ai Agentverse.

**Main Functions/Services Provided:**
* Accepts processed tasks/queries encapsulated in a `ProcessedSolQueryTask` message.
* Reliably interfaces with the external SolQuery FastAPI backend to retrieve and process information.
* Returns structured results encapsulated in a `SolQueryResult` message, suitable for relaying back to the originating client or agent.

**Input Data Model (What this agent expects to receive):**
This agent listens for messages of type `ProcessedSolQueryTask`.
```python
class ProcessedSolQueryTask(Model):
    task_id: str         # A unique identifier for the task/query session.
    query_for_solquery: str # The specific query string to be sent to the SolQuery FastAPI backend.
                         # This query is expected to have been refined or generated by an initial LLM 
                         # (e.g., ASI1-Mini) based on the end-user's original natural language input.
```
